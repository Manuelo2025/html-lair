        <h2>The Early Years</h2>
        <p>The arts called me right from my early days; yeah, as early as I could remember.<br />
           From composing music and songs that never existed to writing poems and short stories, I was always in love with the arts.<br />
           And then it went to singing in a language I never knew, or more like, never existed. Ha! I was creating my own language, even though, I never really did think it that way then.<br />
           I was just having fun, and I loved it. I still do!<br />
        </p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>As I grew older, I started to take my passion for the arts more seriously. I began to study music theory and composition, and I started to write my own songs and poems.<br />
           I also started to explore other forms of art, such as painting and photography.<br />
           I found that the arts were a way for me to express myself and to connect with others in a deeper way.<br />
           I was able to share my thoughts and feelings with the world, and I found that this was a powerful way to communicate.<br />
